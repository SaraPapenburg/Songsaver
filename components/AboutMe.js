                Hi, my name is Sara <br />
        This project's goal is to build a songsaver list using React.
            <br />
     It is also the second to last project of the course
            <br />
            which means, that it is not an easy task to complete.
            <br /> <br />
            As a music lover this project was a fun way to learn about React.
            <br />
           It was a real challenge to make everything work and I am far from a pro still.
           <br />
           Onto the final assignment and completing the FED course.
            </p>
        </div>
